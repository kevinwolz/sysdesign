\title{Create a Nelder Fan experimental design}
\usage{
nelder(DN, D1, N, tau = 1, even = FALSE, max.angle = 360)
}
\arguments{
\item{DN}{Plant density within the last experimental arc (plants ha-1) (i.e. lower extreme of experimental plant density range)}

\item{D1}{Plant density within the first experimental arc (plants ha-1) (i.e. upper extreme of experimental plant density range)}

\item{N}{Number of experimental arcs (i.e. number of densities to be tested within D1 to DN)}

\item{tau}{The "rectangularity" proportion. "Rectangularity" is the proportional relationship between the arc length between
spokes and the radial length between arcs, where the numerator represents the arc length and the denominator represents
radial distance. This proportion has been referred to as "rectangularity" in the historical literature and it remains constant
throughout the design. Given that the inner and outer borders of the growing space shape surrounding a plant in a Nelder
design are arcs, and that the shape is not truly rectangular or trapezoidal in nature, the term "rectangularity" can be
confusing.}

\item{even}{Logical indicated whether or not the design should be adjusted so that the angle between spokes goes evenly
into \code{max.angle} (i.e. so that there are no spokes that must be removed from the experiment as border spokes).}

\item{max.angle}{The maximum rotation (in degrees) of the design. If 360, then a full circle design will be created.}
}
\value{
An object of class "sysd" and class "nelder". This is a list of 3 elements:
\itemize{
 \item{"plants"}{ - A data frame (tibble) containing one row for each for each plant in the design.}
 \item{"plot"}{ - A data frame (tibble) containing plot charateristics.}
 \item{"optim"}{ - If \code{even = TRUE}, a data frame (tibble) comparing plot characteristics between the scenario
 where theta is even throughout the design and the scenario where theta is uneven.
 If \code{even = FALSE}, then \code{FALSE}.}
}

\description{
Creates a Nelder Fan experimental design.
}
\details{
The Nelder Fan or Nelder Wheel experimental design (Nelder 1962) is an experimental design that systematically
varies plant desnity within a single plot. This function creates Nelder Fan Type Ia (Nelder 1962), where the growing area
around each plant has a constant shape throughout the design but increases as radius increases.
The terminology and calculations used here follow Parrott, Brinks, and Lhotka (2012).
