\title{Create a Goelz Triangle experimental design}
\usage{
goelz(N = 35, reps = 1, split = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The number of plants to be on each edge of the design.}

\item{reps}{The number of independent designs to create.}

\item{split}{A logical indicating whether the result should be in "split" format or not.}
}
\value{
An object of class "sysd" and class "goelz".
If \code{split = FALSE}, this is a list of data frames (tibbles) containing one row for each for each plant in the design.
The length of the list is equal to \code{reps}.
If \code{split = TRUE}, this is a list of three elements:
\itemize{
 \item{"triangle"}{ - A data frame (tibble) containing one row for each for each plant in the design,
 but not including the species identity.}
 \item{"design"}{ - A list of numeric vectors containing the species identities (1, 2, or, 3).
 The length of the list is equal to \code{reps}.}
 \item{"A.design"}{ - A list of numeric vectors containing the species identities (1, 2, or, 3) of plants in zone A.
 The length of the list is equal to \code{reps}.}
}
}
\description{
Creates a Goelz Triangle experimental design.

\details{
The Goelz Triangle experimental design (Goelz 2001) is an experimental design that systematically
varies species composition of three plant species within a single plot, while maintaining a constant plant density.
This function creates a Goelz Triangle design following several criteria set forth by Goelz (2001):
\itemize{
 \item{"symmetry"}{ - Symmetry requires that, for every planting spot assigned, the 2 corresponding planting
 spots be assigned corresponding species.}
 \item{"equality"}{ - Equality merely requires that equal numbers of each species be assigned to each plot.
 This will be achieved if the number of planting spots per plot is a multiple of three and if symmetry is imposed.}
 \item{"conformity"}{ - Conformity to the intended pattern requires that the species proportion in any subsection of the
 triangular plot is close to the expectations.}
}
This function does NOT robustly impose the conformity criterion. Species are assigned randomly to each position by sampling
the three species using weights based on the theoretical probability of each species at that point.
For a robust implementation of the conformity criterion that optimizes the rough initial approach of this function using an
evolutionary algorithm, use \code{\link{goelz_optim}}.
